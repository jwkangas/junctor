# Junctor/Adjunct

*Junctor* and *Adjunct* are programs for Bayesian learning of decomposable graphs from full data. The algorithmic techniques used and some experimental results produced by the programs are presented in the following papers:

> K. Kangas, M. Koivisto, and T. Niinimäki. Learning chordal Markov networks by dynamic programming.
> *In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 27* (NIPS), 2014.

> K. Kangas, T. Niinimäki, and M. Koivisto. Averaging of Decomposable Graphs by Dynamic Programming.
> *In Proceedings of the 31st Annual Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence* (UAI), 2015.

*Junctor* is the exact implementation used in the experiments of the first paper.

*Adjunct* is a more recent version used in the second paper and subsumes all features of *Junctor*.
